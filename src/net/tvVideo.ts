/**
 * THE CAMERAMAN — a real picture for THE CHANNEL.
 *
 * FFTV began as a POSE STREAM: the caster sent numbers (heads, hands,
 * health, balls) and the stat page drew a top-down diagram from them. That
 * is cheap and it is legible, but it is a diagram, and a diagram is not
 * television — you cannot see the paint on a player, the titan filling the
 * sky, or the room the fight is happening in.
 *
 * So this renders the scene a few times a second from a camera nobody is
 * wearing, shrinks it to a postcard, and sends it as a JPEG. Motion JPEG
 * over the relay we already have: no media server, no WebRTC signalling,
 * no TURN, nothing new on the free tier that hosts the room.
 *
 * The three things that make it affordable:
 *
 *  1. A TINY TARGET. 256×144 is a thumbnail, and a thumbnail is what the
 *     page shows. The cost of the extra pass scales with pixels, and there
 *     are 37k of them against a headset's several million.
 *  2. AN ASYNC READBACK. `readRenderTargetPixelsAsync` fences the copy
 *     instead of stalling the pipeline on it, which is the difference
 *     between costing a slice of GPU time and costing a dropped frame.
 *     Reading a render target synchronously inside an XR frame is how you
 *     make a headset stutter, and a bout must never pay for television.
 *  3. A LOW RATE. Three frames a second. It is a window into a match, not
 *     the match.
 *
 * THE XR CATCH: inside an immersive session `renderer.render()` ignores the
 * camera you hand it and uses the headset's own, because `xr.isPresenting`
 * substitutes the XR camera array. To shoot from anywhere else the flag
 * comes off for exactly one render and goes straight back on — the standard
 * spectator-view trick, and the reason this is a module rather than four
 * lines in a system.
 *
 * Everything is best-effort: one capture in flight at a time, failures are
 * swallowed, and a headset that cannot do any of it simply never sends a
 * picture. The pose frame keeps being sent alongside, so the page always
 * has something to draw and the diagram remains the fallback.
