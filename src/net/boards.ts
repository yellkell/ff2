/**
 * THE BOARDS — every leaderboard in the app, one shape.
 *
 * FF2 had three different answers to "where does a score go". The 1v1 ladder
 * and aim training lived as fields on the player document. PvE runs were
 * APPEND-ONLY logs — `runGauntlet`, `runRaid`, `runGoopliath` — a fresh
 * document per attempt, so a board was a pile of every run anyone had ever
 * made and the client had to sort the wheat out of it on read. RAVE RAID, in
 * a different project entirely, had already worked out the better answer, and
 * the pub's arcade board was a single hand-maintained document.
 *
 * This is RAVE RAID's answer, applied everywhere:
 *
 *     boards/{board}/rows/{uid}
 *
 * ONE DOCUMENT PER PLAYER PER BOARD. A board is a table of personal bests,
 * not a log. Three things fall out of that, all of them good:
 *
 *  - Nobody can flood a chart. Fifty runs overwrite one row fifty times.
 *  - The rules can prove ownership from the document's own NAME, without
 *    trusting a field the client filled in.
 *  - A better run REPLACES a worse one, and the rules refuse the write if it
 *    doesn't actually beat what's there — so the ratchet is server-side, not
 *    a favour the client does us.
 *
 * DIRECTION LIVES IN THE BOARD ID. An id ending `-time` is a race and ranks
 * low-to-high; everything else ranks high-to-low. That convention is load
 * bearing — firestore.rules reads it with a regex to decide which way the
 * ratchet turns, without a lookup. Add a timed board and you MUST name it
 * `-time` or its rows will ratchet the wrong way.
 *
 * Everything here fails soft. No cloud, no network, a project with auth off:
 * a read returns an empty board marked 'off', a write is dropped, and the
 * local record book — which is the real source of truth for your OWN bests —
 * is untouched either way.
