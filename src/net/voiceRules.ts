/**
 * WHO HEARS WHOM — the one table every voice path reads (DESIGN §3.2,
 * phase 6). The mechanics live elsewhere (net/voice.ts pins duel and mesh
 * voices to heads, pub/voice/* is the club's PCM relay); this module only
 * answers the question they all ask before opening a mic or an ear.
 *
 *   RANKED    silence. No mic, no ears. The ladder is played alone with
 *             the noise of the crowd — trash talk is for the club.
 *   DUEL      quick and private bouts: the two fighters hear each other.
 *   BRAWL     2v2 / FFA: every fighter on the platforms.
 *   RAID      the squad, from the lobby through the run.
 *   CLUB      spatial — the whole floor, falling off with distance.
 *   AUDIENCE  watchers hear the fighters and each other; fighters never
 *             hear a watcher's words, only the crowd as a crowd (the
 *             hands-up roar — audio/crowd.ts). The audience wire itself
 *             lands with the presence work; the rule is settled here.
 *
 * The SETTINGS breaker (audio/voicePref.ts) is the master switch on top:
 * off means off everywhere, whatever the table says.
