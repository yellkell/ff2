 * yet creates an OPEN lobby doc in Firestore and waits; a second boxer claims
 * it (flipping it closed) and they pair up. So the number of FRESH, still-open
 * lobbies is exactly the number of people standing in the queue right now.
 *
 * We subscribe to that collection only while the lobby menu is on screen and
 * tear the listener down the moment a bout/training/pub starts — and the
 * Firebase bundle is imported lazily, so players who never open the 1V1 panel
 * (and the whole bot/training path) still never pay for it.
