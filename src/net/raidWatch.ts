/**
 * Live "N raids open" count for the ARCADE panel's RAID button.
 *
 * The room browser (lobbyWatch) only watches while its modal is on screen, and
 * only one arcade mode at a time — so the main lobby had no idea whether any
 * raid squad was forming until you clicked in. This watcher mirrors the RANKED
 * button's "N OPEN" badge: subscribe to the open raid rooms for the whole
 * lobby stay, count the LIVE, joinable ones (same freshness rules as the
 * browser list), and tear down when a bout/training/pub starts.
 *
 * Kept separate from lobbyWatch on purpose: that module is a singleton keyed
 * to ONE watched mode, and the browser modal re-points it (2v2/ffa/raid) —
 * sharing it would make the badge and the browser fight over the sub.
