/**
 * Firebase-backed leaderboards, riding the same Firestore project that does
 * matchmaking (collection `players`, one doc per anonymous player id).
 *
 * Two boards:
 *  - 1V1: ranks SCORE — a real win banks a flat +20, a practice win over the
 *    bot a token +2; losers lose NOTHING. A HIDDEN per-player ELO (K=32) still
 *    moves on every REAL result (rival-quality signal for matchmaking) but no
 *    longer weights the score, and the bot has no rating to move.
 *  - AIM TRAINING: personal-best run scores.
 *
 * Identity is a localStorage uuid with a derived IRON-XXXX callsign — no
 * sign-in. Firestore + firebase/app load lazily so lobby/bot players who
 * never go online don't pay for the bundle. Needs Firestore rules opening
 * the `players` collection (same hackathon-grade shape as `lobbies`).
