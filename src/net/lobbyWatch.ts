/**
 * Live list of open arcade LOBBIES for the lobby browser — 2v2, ffa or raid.
 *
 * A host creates an OPEN room doc in `arcadeRooms` (tagged with its `mode` and
 * the squad's callsigns); this watcher subscribes to the rooms of ONE mode and
 * reports the fresh, still-open, not-yet-started ones so the browser can list
 * them (each shows the host's name, the head-count and the raid hardcore flag).
 *
 * Same lifecycle discipline as rankedWatch: subscribe only while the browser is
 * on screen, tear it down on host/join/close, and load Firebase lazily so
 * players who never open a lobby never pay for the bundle.
