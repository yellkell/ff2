/**
 * THE GASKET GAZETTE — the game's daily paper, pinned to the NEWS tab.
 *
 * A scheduled Claude task reads the boards every day and files an edition
 * into Firestore at `gazette/latest`: what happened (who climbed, which
 * records fell, the hardest clears), the numbers behind it, and — the part
 * that makes it worth opening — WHAT YOU CAN GO AND DO about it today. Plain
 * reporting in newspaper form; no character, no in-joke vocabulary
 * (docs/gasket-gazette.md has the style guide and the pipeline).
 *
 * This module is the lobby's reader: it pulls the latest edition, and tracks
 * whether THIS player has read it yet so the NEWS tab can wear a red
 * notification dot until they do. Rides the same Firestore project as
 * matchmaking + the leaderboard; loads firebase lazily like leaderboard.ts so
 * offline lobby players never pay for the bundle.
