/**
 * CrowdSystem — the crowd bed's clock and the HANDS-UP detector.
 *
 * Raises the bed (audio/crowd.ts) the frame a bout goes live and lowers
 * it back in the lobby; drains the sound kit's cue sheet each frame so a
 * landing swells the crowd. And it reads the one gesture the audience is
 * allowed into the fighters' ears: BOTH HANDS ABOVE THE HEAD. Two
 * controller heights against the head's — cheap — eased into a 0..1
 * level. Today that is your own hands (raise them at the bell and the
 * terrace answers); once the audience travels with the squad the same
 * byte rides the room wire and the relay's aggregate lands here instead.
