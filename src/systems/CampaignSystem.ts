/**
 * ARCADE — the titan gauntlet. Owns a campaign bout end to end:
 *
 *  INTRO   : klaxon + strobing pit light, the titan grinds up out of the
 *            floor behind the far platform, name card + roar, FIGHT, bell.
 *            (Squeeze a trigger to skip the ceremony.)
 *  FIGHT   : the titan cycles telegraphed attacks — every kill zone charges
 *            visibly ON YOUR PLATFORM (see campaign/telegraphs.ts): fist
 *            SLAMS (a ghost hammer descends onto the disc — step out),
 *            horizontal SWEEPS (duck the travelling blade), eye BEAMS
 *            (sidestep the strip) and pod VOLLEYS (fireballs hurled straight
 *            at you — dodge them or BLOCK with a fist). Damage runs on
 *            per-boss WEAK-POINT PATTERNS
 *            (BossDef.weakPattern): whatever is vulnerable BLINKS — the
 *            visor tell, the chest core, the low emblem — and everything
 *            else is armour that clanks. Dodge, re-aim, punish, repeat.
 *  VICTORY : collapse, floating payout line (double coins/XP on a first fell).
 *  DEFEAT  : SCRAPPED. The titan stands. Consolation pay.
 *
 * The titan is NOT the pose-bus opponent — OpponentSystem stands down in
 * campaign mode and this system drives its own rig + weak-point hitboxes
 * (CollisionSystem's damageScale law does the rest). GameStateSystem also
 * stands down: a titan bout is one long round with no timer.
