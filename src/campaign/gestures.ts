/**
 * THE GESTURE LANGUAGE — how a titan's BODY reads a move (DESIGN.md §4,
 * second pass: "bespoke gestures per shape"; third pass: the arms grew
 * ELBOWS, WRISTS and FINGERS, every shape uses them, and the CLASSIC kinds
 * joined the language with shapes of their own).
 *
 * The floor telegraph is the near tell; the titan's silhouette is the far
 * one. RAVE RAID's bosses sold every shape with a different gesture. Each
 * SHAPE has a windup, a follow-through, and a gaze, all pure functions of
 * the charge so every client animates the same pose from the same seed:
 *
 *   THE GRAMMAR
 *   point    a lane: ONE arm levels down the strip, straight, finger out
 *   x        THE X: both forearms cross in front, fists closed
 *   scissor  a rail: both arms flat out like wings, snapping across
 *   press    the gate: arms spread, then CLOSE toward the gap that lives
 *   ring     the donut: hands meet overhead, then slam down wide
 *   teach    THE LESSON: the king POINTS at each taught quarter in turn —
 *            and shows an open PALM for a hold
 *   conduct  THE RECITAL: forearms up like a conductor, the baton hand
 *            flicking on every cue; a hold is a palm held out — STAY
 *   march    the wave: the piston drumline — arms pump on the beat
 *   blade    the duckdonut's cut: the classic sweep's wind-out
 *
 *   THE CLASSICS
 *   hammer   the slam: the fist is DRAWN — down and back, elbow cocked —
 *            then hoisted sky-high, trembling at the top before it falls
 *   scythe   the sweep: wound out wide and back, the forearm gathering
 *            for the whip, the off arm counterweighting across the chest
 *   cannon   the beam: one arm locked straight at you — the barrel — the
 *            other hand bracing its elbow; the whole arm shakes as it cooks
 *   launcher the volley: arms swung back and folded, the body rocked back
 *            on its heels for the pods' recoil; every shot jolts it
 *   coil     the nova: both arms overhead, forearms winding round each
 *            other, wrists spiralling, up on the toes — then thrown wide
 *   tilt     the seesaw: arms out flat like a balance beam that TIPS toward
 *            the half about to flood; the low hand slaps it down
 *   shove    the surge: both palms out at chest height, elbows drawn back,
 *            then driven straight — the flood pushed at you
 *
 * An arm's pose is four joints. The SHOULDER is a DELTA from the arm's
 * rest pivot (restX/restZ): `x` is the pivot's pitch (negative raises the
 * arm forward/up — the hammer hoists at −2.5), `z` its yaw about the body,
 * signed per arm by `out` (+1 swings that arm away from the body, −1
 * across it). The ELBOW (`elbow`), WRIST (`wrist`) and FINGERS (`curl`)
 * are ABSOLUTE: elbow 0 is a straight arm and ~2.2 a forearm folded right
 * up; wrist 0 is a hand in line with the forearm, positive bends it
 * forward (a flick, a chop), negative back (a palm held out); curl 0 is an
 * open hand, 1 a fist. ARM_REST is the neutral all of them ease home to.
 * CampaignSystem eases every joint toward the returned targets, so a pose
 * is a destination, never a keyframe — and a cascade whose next read
 * hasn't opened yet (fill 0) simply eases the arms home between steps.
