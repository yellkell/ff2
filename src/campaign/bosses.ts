/**
 * The ARCADE titans — five boss machines in the same 90s robot-wars language
 * as the duel boxer, but built at pit-crane scale, and each one a BESPOKE
 * machine with its own silhouette you can name from across the arena:
 *
 *  I   RUSTHOOK — the scrapyard derelict. Hunched, asymmetric, rust-brown:
 *      a dented drum of a head, mismatched shoulders, exposed rib struts,
 *      and its right arm ends in a giant crane HOOK on a chain link.
 *  II  PISTONKAISER — the foundry press. Anvil-flat crowned head, twin
 *      smokestacks glowing off the shoulders, riveted slab chest, and two
 *      massive rectangular HAMMER-BLOCK fists.
 *  III VULTURE — the executioner. A hooded narrow head with a hooked beak
 *      and ONE round eye (the tracking beam's source), swept wing-plate
 *      pauldrons, a slim tapered trunk and talon-clawed hands.
 *  IV  JUGGERNAUT — the rolling fortress. Squat and WIDE: a dome head sunk
 *      between the shoulders, double-layered bolted chest plates, and a
 *      riveted armour skirt hanging like a tank's curtain.
 *  V   GOLIATH — the king. Near-black plate with gold trim, a five-spike
 *      CROWN, a tall crest, and oversized ceremonial gauntlets.
 *
 * Every rig keeps the same animation contract (head group, visor/eye
 * material, chest CORE, shoulder pod materials, two arm pivots + fists), so
 * CampaignSystem drives them all identically. Geometry + data only;
 * behaviour lives in CampaignSystem.
