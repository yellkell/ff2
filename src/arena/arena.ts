/**

 * corner studs and a thin team-colour rim glow. The environment is intentionally
 * just the two platforms floating in your passthrough room:
 *  - a slab pedestal beneath YOU (ember rim) — underfoot, Blaston-style,
 *  - a matching pedestal across the gap for the opponent (blue rim),
 *  - the FIRE FIGHT title plate hung high behind the opponent (lobby only),
 *  - warm key lighting so the steel and fire read with some form.
 *
 * The guardian-style rim barrier is built and driven by BoundarySystem.
 * These are plain Three.js objects parented under `world.scene` — static
 * set-dressing. Dynamic, interactive objects become ECS entities.

 * The hazard-striped kick-band: an amber warning ring painted round the inside

 * pad it just crowds the deck you stand on, but round a boss pedestal it reads
 * as the machine's own danger marking. Built on every pad and hidden by
 * default; setPlatformHazard turns it on for whichever pedestal is currently
 * carrying a boss (the raid pit always, slot 1 while a campaign titan is up).
 *
 * Built as ONE mitred ring rather than eight separate quads. Eight quads can't
 * meet cleanly at an octagon's corners — butted they leave a wedge of bare
 * steel at every vertex, overlapped they hang off the rim — so the ring is
 * offset properly instead: each corner vertex is the intersection of its two
 * inward-offset edge lines, which is a true mitre and keeps the band a constant
 * width the whole way round.
 *
 * Stripe density is baked into the UVs rather than into a per-edge
 * `texture.clone()` with its own `repeat`. That matters twice over: a clone
 * shares the image but is a separate GPU upload, so the old code pushed eight
 * copies of the same stripe texture per platform — 56 across the seven pads —
 * and `repeat` lives on the texture, so it could not follow a platform that was
 * SCALED. The raid pit is built at 2.4×, which stretched its stripes to two and
 * a half times everyone else's. UVs scale with the mesh; textures don't, so
 * `uvScale` compensates a known group scale and every pad stripes at one pitch.
