/**
 * ClubMirrorSystem — the pier glass on the club's north wall, and the only
 * place in the game you can see your own body.
 *
 * The trick is theatre, not render-to-texture: behind the glass is a dark
 * recess (built with the club), and this system stands REAL mirrored rigs
 * in it — your own figure solved from your live head + hands (exactly the
 * body everyone else is shown), plus whoever's near you, reflected across
 * the wall plane. Geometry mirrors are stereo-correct in VR for free,
 * which a Reflector render-to-texture is not, and they cost nothing when
 * nobody's looking.
 *
 * Performance is the design: the glass SLEEPS as near-black smoke until
 * your head is within CLUB.mirror.range of it. Asleep: zero rigs posed,
 * recess contents hidden, the recess light off — the whole feature is one
 * tinted quad. Awake: at most 1 + maxFigures slender rigs, one point
 * light, three murk planes. Reflections beyond reflectRange simply aren't
 * cast (the murk swallows the boundary), so a packed dance floor never
 * pours 20 extra rigs into the glass.
 *
 * Honest by construction: your reflection is driven by the SAME head/hand
 * frame sendClubPose() streams (full framerate, unsmoothed), in the hue
 * the room sees you in; room-mates' reflections reuse the exact pose
 * objects their floor puppets dance with — blocked dancers cast no
 * reflection because their figures aren't shown. The one lie is chirality
 * (a true mirror flips left/right; posing a normal rig with swapped hand
 * targets flips everything that matters — asymmetric haircuts stay on
 * their built side), which nobody has ever noticed in a nightclub.
