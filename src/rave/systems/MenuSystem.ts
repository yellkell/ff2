/**
 * MenuSystem — the board at the front desk.
 *
 * While you're on a menu screen the ring, stage and light rig are packed
 * away (ArenaSystem/DiscoSystem hide them) and you're standing in the
 * FOYER (ClubSystem owns the places) with one wide BOARD floating in front
 * of the spawn, laid out like a modern live-service lobby:
 *
 *   ┌────────┬───────────────────────────────┐
 *   │ RAVE   │  HEADER: wordmark · status    │
 *   │  RAID  ├───────────────────────────────┤
 *   │ TOUR   │                               │
 *   │ PLAY   │   content cards per tab       │
 *   │ MULTI  │                               │
 *   │ SYSTEM │                               │
 *   └────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * One rail, one content region, no floating sub-panels. TOUR is its own
 * flow screen; PLAY, MULTIPLAYER and SYSTEM are in-panel modes of the
 * lobby. MULTIPLAYER stays locked (greyed) until the first boss falls —
 * tour set 1's finale — then the club opens for good. With a room OPEN the
 * board doesn't exist at all: the club floor's console is the SOCIAL panel
 * (ClubSocialSystem), and the board waits in the foyer.
 *
 * Mid-set the board vanishes and the right controller's A button raises
 * THE PAUSE CARD — a small pop-up dead ahead (the Beat Saber posture):
 * KEEP DANCING or LEAVE THE SET. Nothing stops while it's up — a shared
 * clock can't pause for one dancer — it exists so leaving is a decision,
 * never a slipped button.
 *
 * The look and motion contract lives in ui/panel.ts: quiet glass, one
 * accent, eased hovers, a beat-leaning under-halo. This file decides WHAT
 * each button is (primary CTA / selected / value chip / semantic text);
 * the kit decides how those roles look.
