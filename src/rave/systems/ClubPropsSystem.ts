/**
 * ClubPropsSystem — THE DUMBWAITER and the drinks it serves.
 *
 * No bartender in this house: a brass square set into the bar top RISES
 * with a coupe on it. Take the drink and the square sinks away, pauses,
 * and comes back up carrying another — the venue's quiet little theatre,
 * on a loop, for as long as the floor is open.
 *
 * The holding and throwing is FIRE FIGHT's pub feel, ported whole:
 *
 *  - RANGE GRAB: aim within a 30° cone at a glass inside a metre and
 *    squeeze (or trigger) — it snaps to your hand. The aimable glass
 *    glows so the affordance is never a mystery.
 *  - THROW: a five-frame ring buffer of real hand positions becomes the
 *    release velocity (capped — a coupe is not a fastball), with tumble
 *    seeded from the throw.
 *  - FLIGHT: gravity, wall reflections with per-wall heights (a lob
 *    clears the bar counter; a line drive rings off it), landings on any
 *    surface the venue knows — bar top, booth tables, terrace, stage,
 *    the floor — with bounce, SKID or settle split by speed, and a glass
 *    that eases upright rather than snapping. Substepped, so a hard throw
 *    meets the table edge it's aimed at instead of passing through it.
 *  - SEATED, NOT SUNK: contact is the glass's own lowest point, worked out
 *    from its profile and its tilt, so a coupe on its side lies on its rim
 *    and never puts its stem and bowl through the floor.
 *  - GLASS ON GLASS: they clack off each other and off the ones already
 *    standing about, and a struck glass is claimed off the relay so one
 *    client owns the motion it just picked up.
 *  - DRINK: bring it to your face and the cocktail's gone (the fill
 *    empties with a slurp). New glasses come full.
 *
 * And SHARED, the FIRE FIGHT server pattern (server/index.mjs, DRINKS):
 * the relay brokers ownership and owns the serve clock, so the whole room
 * watches ONE plate raise ONE glass:
 *
 *  - GRAB is optimistic — the hand takes the glass instantly and asks the
 *    relay; if somebody's claim landed first, the relay names the real
 *    holder and the glass leaves the loser's hand. Mid-FLIGHT glasses
 *    are fair game — a catch — exactly the FIRE FIGHT grant rule.
 *  - One owner simulates each moving glass and streams pose + fill at
 *    ~20 Hz; everyone else eases toward the stream (k = 1 − e^(−18Δ),
 *    snapping across big jumps). A settled throw posts its final pose;
 *    resting glasses are server-remembered and walk into late joiners'
 *    'props' snapshots. Dancers dealt onto the ring drop what they held.
 *  - An older relay with no drink words? The plate just stays down.
