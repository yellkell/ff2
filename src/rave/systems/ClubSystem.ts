/**
 * ClubSystem — keeper of the venue's places. The law of the land: where
 * you are is what you're doing.
 *
 *  1. THE FOYER — the menu place, and a piece of THE VOID: a floating
 *     neon-edged platform in the set's own abstract space (pylons, slow
 *     hexes, drifting shards, a horizon with no land), with the board and
 *     the MC. The club's door is the board's MULTIPLAYER seat.
 *  2. THE CLUB — the social place, the warm human room between the voids.
 *     Host or join and the hall swaps in around you — dance floor, eclipse
 *     chandelier, bar, booths, terrace, still room — with your room-mates
 *     live in it (ClubSocialSystem) and teleport movement
 *     (ClubTeleportSystem).
 *  3. THE SET — the game place. The ball fires (or a solo set starts),
 *     both rooms pack away, and the raid takes over — wrapped in the void
 *     environment (DiscoSystem's business).
 *
 * This system builds both interiors once, swaps them per frame, and keeps
 * whichever is open breathing:
 *
 *  - club: the eclipse chandelier counter-rotates and PHASES with the
 *    music, leaning into the kick; the moon brightens on the bar; the
 *    floor's brass inlay (the raid ring's ghost) shimmers; the bar's
 *    ribbed glass pulses slow; candles flicker on one shared flame; the
 *    DJ console blinks; the still room's lamp breathes at rest.
 *  - foyer: the pylons roll a slow wave, the hexes turn, shards drift.
 *
 * Fog belongs to whoever's place is up — this system owns it for the foyer
 * and club and never clobbers the set's (DiscoSystem's) fog.
 *
 * THE STILL ROOM's law is enforced here: step through its door and the
 * club's music drops to a muffled thud through the wall (setAmbientDuck
 * takes the level down AND the top end off), voices untouched.
