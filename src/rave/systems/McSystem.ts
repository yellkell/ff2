/**
 * McSystem — the headliner most nights: a GIANT of the dancers' own kind.
 *
 * Same sleek neon humanoid as the groupies (game/avatars.ts), scaled to
 * ~3.4 m on the centre stage — and his whole body ACTS OUT every attack
 * while it charges, so the tell lives at EYE LEVEL in silhouette instead of
 * on the floor:
 *
 *  beam   : both sticks thrust straight forward, parallel — a lane.
 *  sweep  : one arm out FLAT at neck height on the entry side, cocked back —
 *           then swung across on the landing while HE DUCKS UNDER IT himself.
 *  seesaw : both sticks point at the DOOMED half, then shove the flood in.
 *  surge  : same grammar front/back — a beckon (far half dies) or a
 *           palms-out push (near half dies).
 *  gate   : sticks straight up, parallel and narrow — the gap itself —
 *           leaning to stand the "doorway" over the safe column's side.
 *  nova   : arms spread wide and the whole figure winds a slow full spin,
 *           snapping arms down on the burst.
 *  donut  : arms thrown wide, then hauled in — the gather.
 *  duckdonut: the gather AND the limbo at once — get close and get small.
 *
 * While a move charges, everything of his that GLOWS burns WARN amber —
 * sticks, trim, and the lit sleeves and midriff — while his dark cloth
 * holds his own colour (danger speaks amber, always, but it should not
 * repaint the headliner into somebody else); between moves he does exactly
 * the groupies' dance — one
 * stick up, one down, swapping on the beat — so the crowd's motion and the
 * boss's motion are one language. Zones are platform-local and identical
 * for every seat, so one giant's mime is honest for the whole ring.
 *
 * He faces YOU (me-relative rendering — every dancer sees the show head-on),
 * which means platform-local +x (my right) is HIS left: every directional
 * mime mirrors through `mir()`.
 *
 * On finale nights he only works the count-in: the goop drops in, EATS him
 * (a panicked squash into the rising gel), and runs the set instead.
