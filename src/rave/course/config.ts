/**

 * your feet). What did NOT come across is the attack vocabulary: the moves
 * are RAVE RAID's, they belong to the raid, and a course that throws beams
 * at you is a second raid rather than a second GAME. Out there the floor
 * is the only thing trying anything, and the only verb is the step.

 * repo's `research/`.
