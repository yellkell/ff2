/**
 * The course's instancing kit: everything repeated is an InstancedMesh,
 * every animated glow is per-instance colour, and the reflection is a
 * flipped clone that RE-SHARES the source's live buffers — one extra draw
 * per bank, no second camera, no render target, no resolve (research/02 §3;
 * the club's own mirror trick, borrowed for ground that moves).
 *
 * The venue's GlowBank (arena/voidkit) is the static-placement cousin: it
 * parks its instances once and only ever re-tints them. The circuit's decks
 * MOVE every frame, so this bank keeps a write cursor and rewrites matrices
 * as freely as colours.

/**
 * The reflection of a live bank: the same instance buffers drawn upside
 * down under the black glass. It animates for free because the buffers are
 * shared; only the material darkens.
 *
 * AND IT IS CLIPPED TO THE FLOOR. A flip about a plane is only honest for
 * geometry that stands entirely above that plane, and the circuit's decks
 * do not: a deck carries a two-step KEEL hanging 270 mm under its face, so
 * a deck resting AT ground level has body below the mirror plane, and the
 * flip folds that body back UP through the deck. The visible result was
 * the exact opposite of what the machine is meant to say — the keel that
 * hangs so well under a deck in flight appeared as a stack of blocks
 * sitting ON TOP of every grounded deck, covering the face, the etch and
 * the scan line, and the two ground-level runners wore them the whole way
 * round the circuit.
 *
 * One world-space plane per reflection fixes it at the fragment: keep only
 * what is genuinely under the glass. A deck straddling the floor is cut
 * cleanly at the floor line rather than vanishing, and the reflection of
 * anything at height is untouched, which is where it was always right.
