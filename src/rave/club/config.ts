/**
 * THE CLUB — layout + tunables for RAVE RAID's home venue. (It has no
 * name — the sign over the stage is a moon, not a word.)
 *
 * The club is the room the menus live in (it replaces the bare green room)
 * and the SOCIAL FLOOR for online rooms: everyone in your room stands here
 * between sets, voices carried spatially, teleporting around the venue. When
 * the host drops the set the club packs away and the raid's void takes
 * the room; when the set resolves everyone lands back here together.
 *
 * The look is NEON INDUSTRIAL now that the venue is FIRE FIGHT's (DESIGN
 * §3.3): board-formed concrete, checker plate, galvanised steel, riveted
 * I-beams, black quilted vinyl, hazard amber — the deco plan and its craft
 * level kept, the wardrobe swapped, with saturated colour reserved for
 * light, drinks and signage. Its hero is still the ECLIPSE: concentric
 * suspended steel rings over the dance floor, cyan LED channels on their
 * undersides, slowly counter-rotating and phasing with the music, under a
 * lattice truss.
 *
 * Everything in metres, world space. You SPAWN at the origin — the same spot
 * the raid puts your platform — standing at the near edge of the dance
 * floor, facing the stage (−z). The menu board floats dead ahead, exactly
 * where it always has.
