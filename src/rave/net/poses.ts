 * whatever platform currently owns them, so two people are standing in two
 * different moving frames — which sounds like a pose has to say WHICH frame

 * coordinates, and a rider's head in course world space means the same thing
 * on every headset. The moving frames cancel out the moment you stop
 * describing a body relative to its own floor.
 *
 * What that DOES require is one shared clock — a platform has to be in the
 * same place at the same moment everywhere, or a rider reads as standing
 * beside their deck rather than on it. See `courseBars()` in net/session.ts.
