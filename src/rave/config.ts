/**
 * GOOPLIATH: DANCE RAID — every number the feel depends on.
 *
 * The game: a full-VR techno rave over your real floor. Up to 24 dancers
 * stand on octagonal platforms ringed around one giant gel creature — the
 * GOOPLIATH — who dances on a stage in the middle and throws beat-quantized
 * moves that mark EVERY platform at the same time. You don't fight back.
 * You read the floor, move with the rhythm, and outlast everyone else.
 *
 * Dodge → the chain climbs → points multiply. Get clipped → the chain
 * dies. There are no lives: you dance the whole record and the night
 * GRADES you at the end, S to F, on the share of landings you survived.
 * The one way to end early is three clipped landings BACK TO BACK — a
 * dodge wipes that count, so it's a chain, not a budget. Dancing in
 * rhythm builds the COMBO for bonus points. A live holo leaderboard rings
 * the stage; the top ten dance on raised platforms and the current
 * champion above them all.
 *
 * Dimensions are metres. Times are expressed in BEATS wherever the music
 * rules (the whole game is quantized to the track).

/* ─────────────────────────────── THE MOVES ───────────────────────────────
 * Every move telegraphs on EVERY live platform at once and lands ON a
 * downbeat. The windup is sacred: escalation compresses the gaps between
 * moves, never the read.
 *
 * THE TELEGRAPH IS THE WHOLE INSTRUCTION. Danger shapes fill amber→red:
 * whatever is filling, don't be in it when it lands. Safe ground is drawn
 * with bright DOORPOST rails and chevrons marching INTO it: whatever the
 * chevrons run toward, be there. An experienced dancer never needs a word:
 *
 *  beam   : a strip fills down the deck — SIDESTEP off the lane. A single
 *           laser snaps to one of three slots (middle, or a third out); a
 *           DOUBLE is never two random strips — it is either a TWIN pair
 *           shoulder to shoulder covering one side and the middle (get
 *           across), or a SPLIT evenly either side of centre (stand in the
 *           corridor between them). Deliberate shapes, read at a glance.
 *           A twin usually comes with THE RETURN: a bar after it lands,
 *           the same pair arrives mirrored on the side you just ran to, so
 *           the move walks you across the deck and straight back. On the
 *           EXPERT acts the return almost always comes back a third time,
 *           onto the side it opened on — left, right, left, a rally rather
 *           than a shove, and the shape those acts are built around.
 *  sweep  : the AIR burns, never the floor — a danger roof overhead with a
 *           blazing limbo line as its underside, a short chevron fringe
 *           dripping off it — get UNDER the line (duck). The deck stays
 *           unpainted on purpose: floor paint means "move your feet"
 *           everywhere else, and the sweep's answer is the opposite.
 *  seesaw : one half floods, chevrons march at the centreline — CROSS.
 *  surge  : the seesaw's cousin, front/back.
 *  gate   : the WHOLE deck fills except one clear column, doorposts + both
 *           chevron streams pointing into it — STAND IN THE GAP.
 *  nova   : everything burns EXCEPT one wedge at a shared compass bearing —
 *           the whole ring rotates to the same safe ground together.
 *  duckdonut: the rare late-set COMBINATION — the donut's rim floods AND
 *           the sweep's blade hangs over the safe middle: get to the
 *           centre and DUCK there. Two honest reads at once; both answers
 *           are ones you already know.
 *  routine: THE MEMORY TEST. The deck splits into four quarters and the
 *           boss teaches a ROUTINE — two to four corners, never the same
 *           one twice, each marked with its step number and pointed out in
 *           order by his own body. Then the marks go out, and blocks
 *           crush the three corners you didn't learn. NOTHING calls the
 *           steps: the blocks are visibly falling for two beats before
 *           each landing (routineDropBeats), so the move is already its
 *           own clock and a cue over the top of it was only noise.
 *           The quarter lines stay lit the whole way through: the floor
 *           tells you where the boxes are, never which one is yours.
 *  donut  : the RIM burns and the middle lives — a closing ring with a
 *           bright doorpost circle and chevrons marching INWARD: get to the
 *           centre. Usually opens with a laser straight down the middle,
 *           which drives you OFF centre first, so the pair walks you out
 *           and hauls you back in.
 *  cross  : LASERS FROM THE SIDES. A strip fills ACROSS the deck, fed from
 *           an emitter at one rail — step FORWARD or BACK off it (the beam's
 *           quarter-turn cousin: same read, the other axis). Late on it
 *           lays a stage lane across itself and the safe ground is a cell.
 *           It carries the beam's doubles too, quarter-turned: the TRAP
 *           (two rails closing like jaws, stand in the corridor) and the
 *           VERTICAL TWIN — two shoulder to shoulder taking a whole half,
 *           with the same RETURN a bar later on the other half. Two at the
 *           back then two at the front, and the deck travels that way.

   *  serving the STANDARD tables threw ~0.9 landings a second, half again
   *  the 122–135 shelf's measured 0.57–0.64, and that mid shelf is the
   *  pocket these charts should live in (the first pass aimed at 135–150,
   *  the second at 122–135, and both still ran hot on the floor — the
   *  sweet spot the floor kept asking for is the 110–117 shelf: perked
   *  up, feel intact). So a doubled chart keeps the grid and borrows that
   *  shelf's EVERYTHING — not just the landing cadence but the reads and
   *  the cascades, all converted to the same real seconds: charges from
   *  its own table below (a beam fills ~1.6 s, a gate ~2.2 s, the routine
   *  teaches over ~4 s, exactly what those records serve), a smaller
   *  quota for the half-length phrases, a roomier dead-air ceiling, wave
   *  marches on the record's own beats, and every cascade gap stretched
   *  to the shelf's spacing.
   *
   *  The cascades stretch to the shelf's spacing. Twin volleys answer at
   *  SEVEN chart beats (~2.2 s — the shelf's own bar; every other volley
   *  sits an eighth off the beat, which on these shuffles and struts is
   *  exactly where the groove's ghosts live). Nova chains and the donut's
   *  one-two take EIGHT — the record's own real bar, so the big booms
   *  keep the strongest landings there are. These volleys dominate the
   *  measured density, which is why the quota knobs alone couldn't buy
   *  the band back. All numbers are CHART beats (the record's eighths);
   *  only doubled charts ever read them, and ChoreoSystem's staged
   *  telegraph windows read the spacing off the landings themselves, so
   *  the gates follow whichever table built the move. */

   *  below. Only acts 3 and 4 are reachable (double time is EXPERT's);
   *  the lower rows just keep the arrays' shape coherent.
   *
   *  `chargeBeats` is the read table — the part the earlier passes left
   *  on the doubled clock, which is why the shelf still FELT fast at the
   *  right cadence: a beam was filling in under a second. Each charge is
   *  the standard read × the clock ratio, so in seconds every telegraph
