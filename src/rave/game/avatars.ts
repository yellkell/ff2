/**
 * The other dancers — couture rave mannequins, one per occupied platform.
 * One dark suit — TRUE near-black patent, not cloth dyed in the seat's
 * colour — with LIT sleeves and a lit midriff, dark gloss accessories
 * (helm, gauntlets, heeled boots) and hot neon trim at every seam. The
 * neon is real neon: the hottest elements (the scan-slit, the stick
 * blades, the soles, the jewellery) run WHITE at the core and hand their
 * hue to the halos and the lit cloth around them, the way a lit tube
 * actually reads — a white filament in a coloured bloom. The figure's
 * colour identity lives in what it WEARS and what it CARRIES, against a
 * body that stays black; colour-flooding the whole silhouette made every
 * dancer a one-hue toy, and the hierarchy (hot blades over lit jewellery
 * over glowing cloth over black leather) flattened into mud.
 * The body is shaped, not stacked: a cinched waist under a broad
 * shoulder yoke, hips that flow into the thighs, an elliptical
 * cross-section so the torso has a front, and a sculpted mannequin head —
 * tapered chin, full cranium, a wraparound glass visor carrying a hot
 * scan-slit. Four
 * style variants of neon hair (mohawk / twin blades / horn / twin spikes)
 * derive deterministically from the hue so a full ring isn't 24 clones.
 *
 * The rig is driven entirely from a HEAD position and two HAND targets —
 * exactly what VR actually knows about a person. Everything else is solved:
 * the hips hang under the head, two-bone arms bend at elbows whose pole
 * ADAPTS to the reach (a crossed hand folds its elbow down instead of
 * chicken-winging through the chest; a long thrust rolls it under the arm),
 * the glowsticks ride the forearm as POINTERS and twist with the body's
 * yaw, two-bone legs bend at solved KNEES (so crouching folds the figure
 * instead of telescoping it), and elimination melts the whole thing
 * floorward.
 *
 * YOU have no figure. The local player never sees their own body — your
 * platform shows only your controllers; the elegance is for everyone else's
 * view of you (and the groupies).
 *
 * Everything is authored in PLATFORM-LOCAL space and parented to the seat's
 * platform root, so rank lifts and eliminations carry the dancer with the
 * deck for free. All geometry is procedural and shared module-wide (unit
 * primitives + lathe profiles, cached by key); materials are per-rig (they
 * carry the seat colour and get mutated for hit-flash / elimination).
