/**
 * Match flow — the only place screens change hands. These are plain state
 * mutations; the systems notice (`match.generation`, `match.screen`) and do
 * the physical work: MusicSystem drops the needle, ArenaSystem rebuilds the
 * ring, ChoreoSystem regenerates the set-list, RankSystem re-seats the board.
 *
 * The record decides the shape of the match: a track's measured tempo
 * becomes `match.bpm`, and its playable length becomes `match.phrases` — so
 * the set always ends with the song, and the escalation curve (act
 * boundaries are fractions of the set) stretches to fit whatever is on.
