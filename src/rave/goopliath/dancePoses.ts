/**
 * DANCE STANCES — the GOOPLIATH's pose vocabulary, written for the club.
 *
 * The FIRE FIGHT styles this replaces were boxing guards: subtle weight
 * shifts a fight-reader could parse. A dancefloor needs SILHOUETTES — poses
 * you can name from across the ring while four metres of gel snaps between
 * them on the bar. Same mechanism as the fight styles (per-anchor deltas
 * over the BOXER pose, eased by GelCreature.styleEase), much bigger shapes.
 *
 * Deltas are creature-local metres at man-scale; the parent group scales
 * them to boss size. The creature faces +Z (toward whoever's watching), so
 * −z pulls a fist back toward the body, +y throws it skyward.
 *
 * Radius scales matter as much as offsets: a pointing fist swells 1.3× so
 * the gesture reads as a gesture, not a stray blob.
