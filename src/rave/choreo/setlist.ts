/**
 * The SET-LIST — the entire raid choreographed up front, deterministically,
 * from the match seed.
 *
 * Every move is a telegraph → landing pair quantized to the beat grid:
 * telegraphs start on beats, landings hit BAR downbeats, multi-part moves
 * (slam drumlines, seesaw cascades) step on beats after their first landing.
 * The same seat-local pattern marks EVERY platform simultaneously — one
 * giant's move, twenty-four floors lighting up as one — so the raid is fair
 * by construction and no client ever has to be told what the boss will do.
 *
 * The nova is the exception that proves the rule: its safe wedge is one
 * CANONICAL compass bearing shared by the whole ring (each seat sees it
 * rotated into its own frame), so the entire floor rotates to the same
 * ground together. Pure spectacle, still deterministic.
