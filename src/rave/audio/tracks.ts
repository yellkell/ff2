/**
 * THE RECORD BOX — the real tracks, and everything the game needs to dance
 * to them.
 *
 * Every number here was MEASURED from the files themselves, not guessed:
 *
 *  - `bpm`      : onset-flux autocorrelation, then phase-locked across the
 *                 whole track at 0.005 BPM resolution. Four of these land on
 *                 exact integers (a DAW grid); three genuinely sit a hair
 *                 under, and using the rounded value visibly drifts off the
 *                 kick by the last third — so the fractions stay.
 *  - `downbeat` : seconds from file start to BAR 1 BEAT 1 (a 4-beat energy
 *                 vote picks which beat of the bar is the downbeat). This is
 *                 the one number a human ear might want to nudge: if a set
 *                 ever feels like it lands on the 2 instead of the 1, move
 *                 this by ±(60/bpm) and nothing else changes.
 *  - `lufs`     : EBU R128 integrated loudness (ffmpeg ebur128). The spread
 *                 across these masters is 7.6 dB — swag comes in at −15.7
 *                 while sakupened is slammed to −8.1 — so every track is
 *                 gain-matched to TARGET_LUFS at playback. Nothing is ever
 *                 re-encoded; it's a gain node.
 *
 * Adding a track: drop the file in src/assets/music/, run
 * `npm run analyze -- <file>`, paste the row it prints, done. Roles decide
 * where it plays; move a track between roles freely.
 *
 * CHECK THE TEMPO IT GIVES YOU. The analyser's octave fold only looks
 * between 100 and 180 BPM, so a record whose true beat falls outside that
 * comes back as whatever fraction of the grid autocorrelated best —
 * ORIGINAL arrived as 63.333, a third of its real 190 lattice.
 * `tools/octave-check` scores the candidates against the onsets, and
 * `tools/track-check` audits the whole box against the files it describes.
