/**
 * THE PAINT — the model, the wire, the locker and the bake (docs/paint.md).
 *
 * A LOOK is the base tone plus an ordered list of placed paint units —
 * stripes, dots, squares and triangles — each quantized to bytes by
 * construction (u, v, angle, len, wid all live in 0..255; colour and
 * variant are indices), so the caps ARE the validation and the same data
 * renders the same everywhere. This module owns:
 *
 *   - the Look model + localStorage persistence,
 *   - the wire form every room carries,
 *   - the locker (owned, unplaced units) and THE HAND (the unit on the ray),
 *   - the BAKE: each paint surface (meshes tagged `userData.paintPart`)
 *     gets a per-part canvas, base tone first, then every unit oldest
 *     first, uploaded ONCE as the material's map. A repaint happens only
 *     when the look changes; at runtime a painted fighter costs exactly
 *     what a blank costs.
 *
 * TRUE TO SIZE (THE CHART). The body's texture is not square on the body:
 * u runs round each ring by ANGLE, so the front of the shoulders spans
 * almost twice the metres per texel that its height does, the waist a
 * good deal less, and the skull pinches to nothing at the crown. A shape
 * drawn flat on that canvas came out stretched — dots as ovals, squares
 * as oblongs, a stripe fat in one place and thin in the next. So every
 * unit is now rasterized in METRES: each surface carries a chart of its
 * own geometry (ring size and arc length per v), every texel near a unit
 * is measured back to the unit's centre along the surface, and the shape
 * is a signed distance in those metres, antialiased by the texel's own
 * size. A dot is round wherever it lands, a stripe keeps its width round
 * the side, and a mark on the crown is a disc, not a smear. Gear and the
 * hands have no chart (their UVs are the generators' own) and keep the
 * flat canvas measure they always had.
 *
 * Front of the body sits at u = 0.75 (the lofts start on +x and wind
 * through −z at three-quarters).
 *
 * The bake keys off the material's own tone tag (`userData.paintTone`),
 * so a look bakes correctly onto the white body and the onyx body alike —
 * unpainted texels ARE the base tone.
