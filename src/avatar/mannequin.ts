/**
 * THE BLANK — FIRE FIGHT 2's mannequin body (DESIGN.md §5.1), the polish
 * pass: smooth, symmetrical, basic, uniform.
 *
 * One body, TWO base tones — you start ALL WHITE ('blank') or ALL BLACK
 * ('onyx'), picked on the locker's COLOUR tab, and everything past that is
 * the paint system's job. Each tone is its own skin id riding the existing
 * skin machinery, so the pick syncs to rivals and squadmates over the same
 * wire every FF1 skin used.
 *
 * THE CONSTRUCTION RULES (each one answers a real complaint):
 *  - ONE material per body. No trim tone, no joint rubber, no seam bands —
 *    a uniform shell, so nothing can read as "parts".
 *  - ONE SURFACE, FULL STOP. The whole body — neck, shoulders, chest,
 *    waist, hips and taper — is a single LOFT: a stack of elliptical rings
 *    stitched into one indexed mesh with smooth shared-vertex normals.
 *    Chest and pelvis used to be two lofts the IK moved independently, so
 *    the waist visibly opened and closed; there is now no joint there to
 *    come apart. Symmetry is by construction (every ring is centred).
 *  - NO BULGE below the hips. The pelvis loft is monotonic after its
 *    widest ring: hips, then a smooth unbroken taper to a rounded tip.
 *    (The hitbox never bulged — it ends at the BODY_IK pelvis sphere —
 *    and now the body's silhouette says the same thing.)
 *  - The head is a bare egg and NOTHING else: the neck belongs to the body
 *    now, and the head floats clear above it. A head carrying its own neck
 *    drags that neck through its own shoulders on every look-behind; cut
 *    apart, the joint cannot bind, and only the head has to move.
 *
 * Materials carry NO role/accent tags: recolours, the hue wheel and
 * setAvatarAccent all leave the base tones alone. Front faces −z. The
 * BODY_IK hitbox spheres never change — the blank stays exactly as
 * hittable as everything before it, and the visual runs INSIDE them.
