/**
 * Articulated VR hands — the traditional kind: a slim steel palm, four
 * two-segment fingers and an opposable thumb, replacing the huge square
 * gauntlets. They start near-black and BLOOM WHITE when the hand is active
 * (trigger/grip squeezed or a ball mid-return), reusing the same
 * `setGloveLit` machinery via userData.leds. Fingers curl with the trigger
 * (index) and grip (the rest), so your virtual hand tracks your real grip.
 *
 * Knuckles point down local -Z, matching the old glove convention — the
 * grip/ray alignment and fireball anchors all carry over unchanged.
 *
 * THEY TAKE PAINT (avatar/paint.ts, part 'hand') on the PALM BLOCK — the
 * back of the hand, which is the piece of you you look at all match, and
 * the piece the bay's ray hits on the mirror. It has a material of its
 * own: these boxes have no UV islands, so every face samples the whole
 * canvas, and a mark on the shared material would land on all eleven
 * pieces of the hand at once. Both hands bake the same canvas — paint one
 * and the pair wears it. The material's rest colour is the canvas fill
 * (`paintFill`, kept in step by applyAvatarSkin), so an unpainted hand
 * comes out of the bake exactly as it was built, and the white bloom
 * rides the emissive channel, untouched by any of it.
