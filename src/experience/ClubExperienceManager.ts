/**
 * THE TOWN — one World, three places, and the curtain between them.
 *
 * The arena is built at boot. The rave (and the venue, which is the rave's
 * club) is mounted the first time you walk through a door to it, and then
 * kept: its systems stay registered and are paused, its objects stay in
 * the graph and are hidden. Every crossing is the same four beats — the
 * curtain falls, the outgoing place is paused and hidden, the incoming one
 * is shown and played, the curtain lifts — and the XR session, the
 * renderer, the XR origin and the controller spaces are never touched.
 *
 * WHO OWNS WHAT is decided by watching the scene graph rather than by
 * asking: everything under the shared roots (scene, level, camera, player,
 * grip and ray spaces) that IWSDK put there at boot is infrastructure and
 * is never hidden; everything the arena had built by the time the rave was
 * first mounted is the arena's; everything that appears while the rave is
 * up is the rave's. Neither experience has to register its objects, and a
 * glass in your hand (the rave attaches it to a controller space) or a
 * glove on your fist (the arena does the same) is put away and handed back
 * with the world it belongs to.
