/**
 * Lobby music — the "Smoldering" track that rides under the main menu.
 * It starts the moment you enter VR from the landing page (a user gesture, so
 * autoplay is allowed) and loops while you're in the LOBBY. It pauses the
 * instant you start a bout or aim training, and resumes when you land back in
 * the menu. A mute button on the lobby HUD toggles it, and the choice is
 * REMEMBERED in localStorage — mute it once and it stays silent on every future
 * visit until you un-mute.
 *
 * Rides a MusicTrack (WebAudio) rather than an <audio> element: an audible
 * media element at launch trips a Meta Browser media-session crash in the
 * packaged PWA (see musicTrack.ts). Playback is the AND of
 * three gates — entered VR, in the lobby, not muted — funnelled through sync().
