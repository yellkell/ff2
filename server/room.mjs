/**
 * THE ROOM SERVER — FIRE FIGHT 2's one relay process (DESIGN.md §3.3).
 *
 * Three relays, one port, told apart by path:
 *
 *   /rave   the rave's room relay: the club floor, THE BELL's clock and
 *           deal, the dumbwaiter, prop brokering, voice   (rave.mjs)
 *   /pub    the Iron Balls pub: punters, props, the bar TV (pub.mjs)
 *   /ff     the FIRE FIGHT duel relay: quick-match + message relay
 *           (index.mjs) — also answered at / for clients from before
 *           the paths existed
 *   /tv     THE CHANNEL: match casters in, web viewers out, the club's
 *           public floor when nothing is on, the bot's invite post (tv.mjs)
 *
 * Nothing about a relay changes by being mounted here: each keeps its
 * own rooms, clocks and heartbeat, and each still runs alone under its
 * own npm script (server:ff, server:rave, server:pub) on its old port.
 * The health page at / lists all three.
 *
 *   npm run server            # listens on :8787 (or PORT=…)
