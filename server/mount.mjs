/**
 * How a relay module stands on its own — or inside THE ROOM SERVER.

 * Each relay (the FIRE FIGHT duel relay, the rave's room relay, the pub)
 * exports an HTTP handler and a `noServer` WebSocketServer, and nothing
 * else about it cares which socket it was reached through. Run directly,
 * a relay serves itself on its own port with serve(); imported by
 * room.mjs, the three share one port and are told apart by path.
