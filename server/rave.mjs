/**
 * RAVE RAID room relay (ported whole from the dance repo — FF2 runs it as
 * `npm run server:rave`; the rave page talks to it through src/rave/config.ts serverUrl()) — rooms of up to 24 dancers behind 4-digit codes.
 *
 * The game's choreography is deterministic from the seed, so this server is
 * almost embarrassingly small: it mints room codes, tracks who's in the
 * room, and relays. Empty seats are filled with identical seeded groupies
 * by every client — the server never simulates anything.
 *
 * THE CLUB (the social floor) leans on a handful of verbs, all still just
 * relaying — and games are called FROM the floor with THE BALL:
 *
 *  - 'cp' club poses: members stream their spot on the floor; fanned out
 *    with the sender's idx.
 *  - VOICE: binary frames ride the same socket ([8-byte f64 sample rate +
 *    Int16 PCM], see src/club/voice.ts). The relay prepends the sender's
 *    idx as an ascii id and fans them to everyone else — floor or ring.
 *  - THE BALL: any member sends 'ball-up' (their song pick rides along) and
 *    a disco ball hangs in the room for BALL_MS. Members touch it to opt in
 *    ('ball-join'); the caller's touch cancels it ('ball-off') or starts it
 *    early ('ball-go' — a full room should not have to watch the clock).
 *    When the timer runs out HERE (the server owns the clock), the caller plus
 *    everyone who touched get dealt seats, THE seed, and "beat 0 in N ms" —
 *    and only they leave for the ring. The floor stays open: stay-behinds
 *    keep dancing, newcomers keep joining, and a 'game' broadcast tells
 *    everyone who is away playing. Players fold back with 'game-out' when
 *    their set resolves; when the last one returns the ball may rise again.
 *  - DRINKS: the FIRE FIGHT prop broker, poured into this house. The room
 *    keeps a registry of PROP_COUNT glasses; the server owns the DUMBWAITER
 *    clock (like the ball's), so one shared coupe rises on one shared plate:
 *    'serve' names the glass on the pedestal. Ownership is brokered —
 *    'prop-grab' is granted when a glass is free, mid-flight (a catch), or
 *    already the asker's; a losing asker is told who really holds it. The
 *    owner streams pose+fill ('prop', ~20 Hz, stored and fanned out),
 *    'prop-release' marks a throw catchable, and 'prop-rest' parks the
 *    final pose — which is what late joiners get in their 'props' snapshot.
 *    Leavers and dancers dealt onto the ring drop whatever they held.
 *  - COLOUR: a dancer's chosen hue rides the 'host'/'join' greeting and is
 *    carried in the roster, so the figure and name tag on the club floor
 *    wear the colour they picked rather than the one their slot handed out.
 *    'hue' updates it on a room already standing (the board is reachable
 *    from the foyer mid-room). Names deliberately do NOT work this way —
 *    the club's mute/block lists key on them.
 *  - A departing host is replaced by the longest-standing member instead of
 *    folding the party.
 *
 *   npm run server:rave       # alone, on :8788 (or PORT=…)
 *   npm run server            # inside THE ROOM SERVER (room.mjs), at /rave
 *
 * Point clients at it with ?server=wss://your-host:8788 (ws:// in dev).
 * BALL_MS=4000 shrinks the ball timer (the two-headset test uses it).
